fastui Cursor Rules 
1. **Language Requirements**
   - Use only English text and English comments in code
   - Use as much less comments as possible

2. **Tech Stack**
   - TypeScript
   - Turborepo with App Router
   - Motion/React: `import { motion } from "motion/react"`
   - PNPM package manager

3. **Project Structure**
   - Main app location: `./`

4. **Best Practices**
   - Minimize use of `useEffect`
   - Never add Index files

6. **Project Context**
fastui is an AI-powered UI component library and platform designed for modern optym frontend developers and design engineers. It provides high-quality, ready-to-use UI components that are easily customizable and instantly usable in projects built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

The core idea behind fastui is to solve the cold-start problem for developers by offering a curated set of plug-and-play UI components that follow best practices, modern design trends, and efficient code structures. Unlike traditional UI libraries that focus solely on static components, fast ui is built around AI-assisted generation and customization, allowing developers to modify components to fit their needs instantly.

Who are the users of fastUI?
	•	Frontend developers who need high-quality, pre-built UI components of optym or specific business unit theme to speed up development.
	•	Design engineers looking for components that are visually appealing and built with best UI/UX practices.
	•	teams who want to create UI quickly just by providing prompt, image or figma link.
	•	AI enthusiasts who want to leverage AI-powered UI generation to build unique, custom interfaces.
	•	Optym who need a scalable design system across all BUs with AI-assisted customization to maintain consistency across products.
  . Optym engineers who don't want to spend much time on creating UI rather than working on core logical part. So everytime if developer asks fastui to create an UI it will make it only from certain BU components to match the theme and developer needs. 
  -  whenever someone wants to export his component he can export it to storybook for documentation, and fasui will take care of visualisation, filtration and of preview and modification on web to instant changes. 

How is fastui useful?

✅ Instant Access to Quality optym's specific, BU configurable UI Components – A vast collection of battle-tested UI elements following modern design principles.
✅ AI-Assisted Customization – AI suggestions help users modify components to match their BU identity, layout needs, or functionality.
✅ Built for Modern Stacks – Fully optimized for React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
✅ Component Marketplace – Developers can publish, share UI components across optym.
✅ No-Code Styling & Configuration – Adjust components visually without modifying code.
✅ AI-Powered UI Generation – Users can describe a UI component in plain English, figma link or image and MCP in cursor or AI will generate it.

As of now it will not have any authentication or any backend db support to store user actions. It is solely a fully functional MVP now to show how useful it can become.
